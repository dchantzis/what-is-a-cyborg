### Subject

"What is a cyborg? Contrast the way the body is depicted in the cyborg literature with at least one other conception (eg classical neo-platonism, cartesianism, empiricism, Freud, or Foucault)."

---

### Abstract

We are all cyborgs. Natural-born cyborgs at the very least. With every addition of aiding machines to our lives, whether merely using them or having them physically installed to our body, we submit ourselves to a transformative process. We perceive each machine as some part of ourselves and in doing so we accept a conceptual merge with them.

This paper explores this idea and presents some of the different variations of the term “cyborg” and the context in which it was introduced. From the first introduction of the concept in 1960 by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline, to Andy Clarke's radical ideas.

Furthermore, it deals with the philosophical concepts of cartesianism and empiricism and their relation to each definition of the term.

The essay concludes with the paradigm of a character taken from science fiction and explores how each rendering of the term applies to him.

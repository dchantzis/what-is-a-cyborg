The dualistic notion of our human nature, regarding our mind as being separate from our physical body has its roots in the philosophical concept of cartesianism.

Cartesianism is based upon the idea that the mind is separate from the body, it is far more important and better understood. The mind of a man is his indispensable identity and the inner operations of the mind hold more reality than the internal workings of the physical body. One’s true identity is his thoughts and ideas rather than his mortal body.

This concept supports the metaphor of the human body as a machine. According to Barbara Katz Rothman:

```
The application of a technological model to the human body can be traced back to Rene Descartes’s concept of mind-body dualism […]

The Cartesian model of the body-as-machine operates to make the physician a technician, or mechanic. The body breaks down and needs repair it can be repaired in the hospital as a car is in the shop; once fixed, a person can be returned to the community. […] Problems in the body are technical problems requiring technical solutions, whether it is a mechanical repair, a chemical re-balancing, or a “debugging” of the system.

--(Rothman, 1982)
```

The term “cyborg” seems to support this aspect of dualism. In its first introduction by Clynes and Kline the alterations to the human body were necessary to overcome its limitations in the hostile to its nature alien environment of outer space. Since the human body is thought to be just a machine that occasionally requires mechanical as well as chemical maintenance and support to overcome its weaknesses, if we think of an environment of extreme cold as “alien” too, then in order for a man to survive there it seems obvious to accept some alterations or additions.

A cybernetic organism, or for short, a cyborg, is mainly considered to be a being that has both biological and artificial parts. Even if this sentence triggers images taken from the science fiction literature, of beings half human and half robotic, this should only be considered as an extreme use of term. After my research on the subject matter and before I start to analyze my findings, I feel that  I should confess that I now think of myself as a cyborg too.

I might not have any prosthetic appendices to make up for any lost body parts. I do not have electronic pieces of technology surgically attached to any of my neurons so that my sensory abilities could be amplified. Nor do I have any aspirations to install the former, or the latter. I do not even have the need to wear glasses. But I still think that I am a cyborg. And I know that you are too.

We can all be considered as cyborgs in one way or another. We use pen and paper which are devices that enable us to maintain our thoughts and ideas as well as “transfer” them through space and time, so that others can learn of our feelings and experiences. We heavily use mechanical devices to encode our voice and the image of our appearance, transmit them thousands of kilometers away from where our physical bodies are situated and, by the use of technology, decode them so that our friends can sense us. And the various companies that develop these devices keep making them smaller, more accurate and user-friendly to the extent that their use seems to us as easy and natural as blinking our eyes. We have almost become unaware of our connection with them and more importantly our dependency on them.

Whether we are just natural-born cyborgs, or in the early stages of a transformative process to become full-fledged cyborgs as depicted in science fiction stories (which are always set in the no-so-distant future), depends only on our perception of the term.

The findings of my research are presented within the following pages in two parts. The first part deals with some of the different meanings and definitions that are attached to the term “cyborg” as it appears in literature and scientific papers as well as how some of these definitions have come to be. The second part briefly references the concepts of empiricism and cartesianism and how they are related to the depiction of the human body on the subject of cyborgs.

As “literature” I acknowledge the ideas from popular novels as well as comic books, since they have played an important role in shaping my first perceptions about cyborgs, man-machine interfaces, the possible extent that man and machine can be connected and existential issues regarding the point where our natural humanity ends and our artificial, or rather cybernetic, one begins.

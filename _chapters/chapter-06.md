A unique perspective on the transformative process from natural humans to fusions of human and machine is found in a paper titled *“Beating the Meat / Surviving the Text, or How to Get Out of the Century Alive”* by Vivian Carol Sobchack. The author also presents and insight on whether it is preferable transformation or not.

In her paper she does not seem to acknowledge any of Andy Clarke’s views of *“natural-born cyborgs”*. Instead she deals with the idea of our mind, more importantly our thoughts, as being separate of the body. How accepting changes to our physiology by means of technological fusion, is crucial to our survival. Using her own experiences of having her leg replaced by a prosthetic one she  mentions:

```
What many surgeries and my prosthetic experience have really taught me is that if we are to survive our new century, we must counter the millennial discourses that would decontextualize our flesh into insensate sign or digitize it into bits of information in cyberspace, where, as one devotee enthusiastically put it, “it's like having had your everything amputated”

(John Perry Barlow, “Being in Nothingness: Virtual Reality and the Pioneers of Cyberspace,” Mondo 2009 2 (1990): 42)

-- (Sobchack,1995)
```

Referencing the ideas of Jean Baudrillard, the limitations of the human body are, according to her, “merely a sign of its times”.

```
Baudrillard is of a piece with all those in our culture who revile the lived body for its weaknesses and who wish to objectify its terrible mortality away.

There are those, for example, who are obsessed with the body's limited durability and who, through various and often perverse or pathological means, attempt to transform themselves into hard bodies and morbidly lean machines. […] There are also those who refer to their bodies contemptuously as “meat” and “wetware” and, like Hans Moravec, want to ditch the body to “upload” and immortalize consciousness into the neural nets of the datascape.

-- (Sobchack,1995)
```

Sobchack goes on to introduce the phrase *“beat the meat”*.  It refers to the ambition of getting rid of our material body and to have only our consciousness exist through technological devices. In doing so we escape all the weaknesses that come with our physical nature. According to her this is the *“disembodying”* fantasy of both Jean Baudrillard and Hans P. Moravec. However by *“beating the meat”* some compromises have to be made.

Every technological device, whether attached to us or not (hearing aids, mobile phones) is very limited by the technological advantages of our time. There always seems to be the next improved version of that device waiting around the corner for scientists to introduce and we are always eager  replace our previous outdated one.

By accepting that there are weaknesses to our natural body and try to counter them with machines, we only replace these limitations with new ones.

Sobchack finds the mortality of her natural body to be *“significantly precious”*. Even thought she accepts her prosthetic leg and feels grateful for the mobility it gives her, she does not forget that it too is dependent on other her natural leg. Out of context the prosthetic leg is merely an object that only “accepts” responsibility once it is being used. Even then it does not feel pain nor pleasure and it certainly does not bleed as a natural part of the body does.

```
Such a techno-body has no sympathy for human suffering, cannot understand human pleasure, and—since it has no conception of death—cannot possibly place value on a human life.

-- (Sobchack,1995)
```

Our natural body is not just an object that we posses. It holds a higher value to any kind of “techno-body” because of its capacity to feel. Sobchack concludes her analysis with the following:

```
It is only by embracing the lived body in all its vulnerability and imperfection, by valuing the limitations as well as the possibilities of our flesh, and by accepting the mortality that gives us gravity and grace that we will get out of this—or any—century alive.

-- (Sobchack,1995)

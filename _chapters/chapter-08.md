The information I gathered through my research of this topic and presented in the previous chapters, though limited, has brought me to the conclusion that we are all cyborgs. Natural-born cyborgs at the very least. With every addition of aiding machines to our lives, whether merely using them or having them physically installed to our body, we submit ourselves to a transformative process. One that is destined to follow the technological advantages of our times and never seems to stop.

Our culture (in the broadest meaning of the term) through science fiction literature and comic books has been very expressive of the problems that arise with any kind of technological alteration to the material human body. We express our worries on the matter by letting our deepest fears and fantasies manifest through literature, so that we could better dissect, analyze, understand and even accept them.

With every technological innovation we expand our capabilities a step further. We overcome our physical restrictions. Our progress now seems like a fast-forward version of the Darwinian concept of evolution. Downgrading to simpler and less complex technologies seems impossible and unimaginable at the very least.

Out of pure curiosity I am eager to see how our intellect, fueled by our needs, is going to transform  us.

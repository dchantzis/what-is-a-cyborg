The first introduction of the term “cyborg” came from a paper under the title “Cyborgs and Space” dated in 1960. The authors where two N.A.S.A. Scientists, Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline. In this study, they analyzed that in order for a man to survive in the environment of the outer space, it is more preferable and “logical” to alter the bodily functions of man “to meet requirements of extraterrestrial environments” rather than to provide “an earthly environment for him in space”. As an aid to their proposals about human survival, they define the term cyborg as following:

```
For the exogenously extended organizational complex functioning as an integrated homeostatic system unconsciously, we propose the term “Cyborg”.

The Cyborg deliberately incorporates exo-genous components extending the self-regulatory control function of the organism in order to adapt it to new environments.

-- [Clynes and Kline, 1960]
```

The paper continues with an analysis of the “psycho-physiological problems” that would probably arise as a result of a typical travel in outer space and how the cyborg can be used to *“achieve better understanding and utilization of man’s natural abilities”*.

Some of these problems are “Radiation Effects”, “Metabolic Problems and Hypothermic Controls”, “Pressure Muscular Maintenance”, “Oxygenization and Carbon Dioxide Removal” and “Variations in External Temperature”. In each of the cases that they briefly describe, the negative effects of these issues should first be detected by a sensory system of the cyborg and then countered by the injection of the appropriate dose of pharmaceuticals in the man’s body.

In conclusion they state that the solving of numerous adaptive problems in a manned space mission, *“will not only mark a significant step forward in man’s scientific progress, but may well provide a new and larger dimension for man’s spirit as well.”*

Deriving from that paper, I believe, Donna Haraway came up with the following definition:

```
A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction

-- [Haraway, 1991]

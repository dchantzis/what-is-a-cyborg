Empiricism is the philosophical concept that supports the idea of knowledge as a natural product of experience. It gives emphasis to the notion that ultimately all our knowledge is based on our sensory perception of the world and is derived from our experiences. Moreover because the experiences that we gain from our surroundings are constant, our knowledge changes, adapts and grows.

A connection between empiricism and Clarkeâ€™s view of humans as natural-born cyborgs is obvious. Clarke based his theory on the natural ability of the human brain to recognize patterns that exist in  reality as we perceive it, in processing combinations and separations of different information and in building knowledge derived from those results. The brain stores the appropriate information that it needs to produce knowledge. The stored information is not only expanded but also repeatedly reevaluated and altered in order to become more productive. In other words it relies heavily on the sensory experiences of the human.

The concept of empiricism in relation to the cyborg theory can be expanded to the use of physical tools. The skilled use of the correct tool renders the user unaware of its presence to such a degree that the brain perceives the tool as part of the body. Since the brain recognizes and stores patterns of information, regardless of whether they refer to concept ideas or the use of material tools, the knowledge of how to use them can be adjusted and expanded as well. If a new more technologically advanced tool is introduced, one that is even easier to use than its predecessor, the brain will simply adjust the appropriate information to refer to it.

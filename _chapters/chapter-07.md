Anthony Edward “Tony” Stark is a fictional character created by writer Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber and artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. He originally appeared in the pages of “Tales of Suspense” #39, a comic book dated in 1963 and published by Marvel Comics. Tony Stark by donning a hi-tech armor transforms himself to the “Invincible” Iron Man. Stories of this character are still being published today and the adventures of Iron Man have spawned comic books, literary books, animated movies, television series, as well as live action movies.

This chapter analyses the character of Tony Stark and his uncanny transformations through the prism of the cyborg theories that were presented in the previous chapters. The character's origin has been altered and updated numerous times throughout the years, so that the technological advantages of his armored alter-ego are more relevant to our present concepts of breakthrough technology. In the following analysis I select the most recent origin as it was presented in the live action movie titled “Iron Man” which was released in 2008.

From his birth Tony Stark is a highly capable natural-born cyborg, since he is depicted as a genius inventor and engineer and thus a brilliant problem-solver.  As an inventor whenever he is presented with a problem his mind selects the relevant stored information, combines this information however it seems fit in order to solve the problem by creating a device. Through this process gains more knowledge and new information is stored away for future use. In other words his mind evolves through experience, a process which is in tune with Andy Clarke's theories.

Stark drives cars and motorcycles. These are machines, more precisely “exoskeletons”, that help him travel to other geographical places in minutes or hours. Distances that in previous cultures would have surely taken him days or weeks. In that way his sense of time and space is expanded. The notion of traveling that fast does not fade when he is not using them, as he always thinks that he can travel at that speed. Every time he has to cover great distances he automatically acknowledges that he has to use these exoskeletons. In doing so he accepts a conceptual merge with them. He perceives them as some part of himself.

At some point in his life Stark suffers a serious injury where, small shards of metal have entered his body and slowly work their way to his heart. During captivity he invents and installs an electromagnetic device on his thorax that will keep the shards away from his heart. Stark has found a solution that will keep himself alive, though rendering him always dependent of the device. This device is permanently attached to his body and produces electromagnetic pulses that are now critical for his survival, thus making him a cyborg in the Clynes and Kline definition of the term. A problem regarding his survival was presented and then countered by the use of his ingenious intellect to create a technological innovation.

From that point on Stark continues to evolve as a cyborg. In order to escape from captivity he creates an early version of a full-body mechanical armor. This exoskeleton protects his body and features weapons that are essential for his escape. Later on he revisits his initial designs of this body armor and creates a more technologically advanced one to replace its outdated predecessor. The new armor now provides him with even more abilities. Oxygen supply to help him breathe, enhanced physical strength, flight capabilities, wireless connection, more advanced weapons and numerous other features to aid him in his adventures. Stark now embraces the merge with his armor and his transformation to a superior being. The concept of upgrading his mechanical appendices seems to follow Vivian Carol Sobchack's point of view on the ever changing and updating technologies of “prosthetics” that expand the limitations of his body.

With every technological alteration to his armor and to the electromagnetic device on his thorax so that his body can survive better to his natural environments as well as in whatever alien environments his adventures take him, Stark brings himself even closer to the idea that Clynes and Kline had when they first introduced the term “cyborg”:

The Cyborg deliberately incorporates exogenous components extending the self-regulatory control function of the organism in order to adapt it to new environments.

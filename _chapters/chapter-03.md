Andy Clarke, an expert on the subject of cyborgs, in his book titled *“Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies, and the Future of Human Intelligence”* replaces the previous definition of a cyborg as being explicitly a hybrid between human and machine, with the notion that all humans are “natural-born” cyborgs.

For  Clarke, what makes us all cyborgs is not so much our ability to use physical tools but in the way our brain functions, its natural ability to  recognize patterns and *“enter into deep and complex relationships with non-biological constructs, props, and aids”* in order to solve problems. However, this ability depends heavily on how accessible we are in processing various combinations of information as well as the ability to separate between them. The brain selects and stores information that when used are most likely to produce much more complex ones, depending on the problem at hand.

In order to better explain this idea, he presents the simple example of using pen and paper to calculate the result of multiplying large numbers. The brain breaks down the action of calculating large numbers to basic calculations of smaller numbers by using *“its capacity for simple pattern completion”* and afterwards stores the results on paper. This action is repeated until the result of the original multiplication is reached. This *“acting in concert with pen and paper”* becomes so reliable to the brain, to the point that it is rendered impossible to calculate larger sums on its own.

```
What makes us distinctively human is our capacity to continually restructure and rebuild our own mental circuitry, courtesy of an empowering web of culture, education, technology, and artifacts.

We are all natural-born cyborgs because of the way that our brain works. And if our brain can recognize patterns in theories and ideas and then incorporate those parts to function more efficiently, then it must certainly do the same with physical objects to overcome obstacles when the opportunity arises. We use numerous such objects, or more accurately “devices”, in our everyday routine with such a high frequency that we become unaware of how much we need them, or as Clarke puts it “as far as our conscious awareness is concerned, the tool itself fades into the background, becoming transparent in skilled use”.

An example of this is the use of mobile phones. By the use of this device we can communicate with other people regardless of the obvious geographical constraints, but we can also maintain that communication while traveling ourselves. These little machines are constantly being amplified with so many features (multimedia players, wireless connection, web-browsing capabilities) that have revolutionized our communication habits. Moreover we find ourselves constantly carrying them in our pockets and spend so many hours holding and using them that in the end they feel part of ourselves.

Clarke notices that and points out:

```
Finnish youngsters have dubbed the cell phone “kanny”, which means extension of the hand. The mobile is thus both something you use (as you use your hands to write) and something that is part of you.
